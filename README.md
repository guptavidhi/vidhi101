A webpage for me!

This code is written for a webpage created for fun. Its hosted by AWS EC2, DNS Route 53, domain name registered at Namecheap. 
Lot of love and tears.

A couple of imprvements which are work in progress:
> the yellow button's icon is not in the center
> the feedback form is original and not a google form, using flask framework and SQL server to store responses
> thinking of a way to save the notes
> integrate a proper searcj option
